SQLite Notes
============

SQLite's type system is different from other databases. SQLite stores data in
five simple types:

+-------------------------------+-------------+
| Python type                   | SQLite type |
+===============================+=============+
| ``None``                      | ``NULL``    |
+-------------------------------+-------------+
| ``int``, ``bool``             | ``INTEGER`` |
+-------------------------------+-------------+
| ``float``, ``Decimal``        | ``REAL``    |
+-------------------------------+-------------+
| ``str``                       | ``TEXT``    |
+-------------------------------+-------------+
| ``bytes`` / buffers           | ``BLOB``    |
+-------------------------------+-------------+

Notably SQLite does not natively support:

* **datetime / date** - store these as ISO-formatted text or as unix timestamps.
* **fixed-precision decimals** - no native type. cysqlite stores ``Decimal`` as
  ``REAL`` by default, which can lose precision for values that aren't exactly
  representable as floats. Register a custom :ref:`adapter <sqlite-notes-adapters>`
  to store as ``TEXT`` if exact precision is required.
* **boolean** - emulated as integer ``1`` and ``0``.
* **json** - SQLite has JSON support, but it is stored as ``TEXT`` or ``BLOB``
  (for JSONB).

SQLite will store any value in a column regardless of its declared type, using
`type affinity <https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#type_affinity>`_ to
influence how the data is stored. Strict typing is opt-in with `strict tables <https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html>`_
(requires SQLite 3.37.0+).

For convenience, cysqlite applies the following rules for adapting Python types
to match SQLite's available data-types:

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Python type                   | SQLite type                               |
+===============================+===========================================+
| ``datetime``                  | ``TEXT`` (isoformat with ' ' delimiter).  |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| ``date``                      | ``TEXT`` (isoformat)                      |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| ``Fraction``, ``Decimal``,    | ``REAL``                                  |
| ``__float__()``               |                                           |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| **Anything else**             | ``TEXT`` (coerced to ``str()``) or custom |
|                               | via :meth:`Connection.register_adapter`.  |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

Examples:

.. code-block:: python

   values = [
       None,
       1,
       2.3,
       'a text \u2012 string',
       b'\x00\xff\x00\xff',
       bytearray(b'this is a buffer'),
       datetime(2026, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).astimezone(timezone.utc),
       datetime(2026, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
       date(2026, 3, 4),
       uuid.uuid4(),  # str()
   ]

   for value in values:
       row = db.execute_one('select typeof(?), ?', (value, value))
       print(row)

   # ('null',    None)
   # ('integer', 1)
   # ('real',    2.3)
   # ('text',    'a text ‒ string')
   # ('blob',    b'\x00\xff\x00\xff')
   # ('blob',    b'this is a buffer')
   # ('text',    '2026-01-02 03:04:05+00:00')
   # ('text',    '2026-02-03 04:05:06')
   # ('text',    '2026-03-04')
   # ('text',    '0c4ca10a-56ab-470a-9357-d28366d97ceb')

.. _sqlite-notes-adapters:

Adapters
---------

You can add custom adapters to control exactly how Python types are sent to
SQLite using :meth:`Connection.register_adapter` and the :meth:`~Connection.adapter`
decorator. For example, it may be desirable to store ``Decimal`` values as
``TEXT`` in order to avoid float-point precision issues, or to store ``date``
as an 8-digit integer:

.. code-block:: python

   db.register_adapter(Decimal, str)

   @db.adapter(datetime.date)
   def adapt_date(value):
       return int(value.strftime('%Y%m%d'))

   values = [
       date(2026, 3, 4),
       Decimal('1.3'),
   ]

   for value in values:
       row = db.execute_one('select typeof(?), ?', (value, value))
       print(row)

   # ('integer', 20260304)
   # ('text',    '1.3')

.. _sqlite-converters:

Converters
-----------

By default, no special attempts at type inference are applied to data coming
**from** SQLite. As you can see in the above examples, all our Python values
were coerced to reasonable SQLite-friendly representations. But that richness
is lost when reading data from SQLite into Python without specific helpers that
read each column's declared type.

To convert data going from SQLite into Python, you will need to register one or
more converters using :meth:`Connection.register_converter` or using the
:meth:`Connection.converter` decorator. Converters rely on the SQLite
`sqlite3_column_decltype <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/column_decltype.html>`_
API, which retrieves the declared type of the given column. cysqlite then
applies your converter for any type that was registered.

For example, to convert columns declared ``DATETIME`` back to Python datetimes:

.. code-block:: python

   db = cysqlite.connect(':memory:')

   db.register_converter('datetime', datetime.datetime.fromisoformat)

   # Or use a decorator:
   @db.converter('datetime')
   def convert_datetime(value):
       # Converts our ISO-formatted date string into a python datetime.
       return datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(value)

If the value is ``NULL`` then the convert function is **not** applied, so you
do not need to test for ``value is None``.

Below are some examples:

.. code-block:: python

   db = cysqlite.connect(':memory:')

   @db.converter('datetime')
   def convert_datetime(value):
       # Converts our ISO-formatted date string into a python datetime.
       return datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(value)

   # Automatically parse and load data declared as JSON.
   db.register_converter('json', json.loads)

   # Handle decimal data.
   @db.converter('numeric')
   def convert_numeric(value):
       return Decimal(value).quantize(Decimal('1.00'))

   db.execute('create table vals (ts datetime, js json, dec numeric(10, 2))')

   # Create a TZ-aware datetime and a JSON object.
   ts = datetime.datetime(2026, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).astimezone(datetime.timezone.utc)
   js = {'key': {'nested': 'value'}, 'arr': ['i0', 1, 2., None]}
   dec = Decimal('1.3')

   # When we INSERT the JSON, note that we need to dump it to string.
   db.execute('insert into vals (ts, js, dec) values (?, ?, ?)',
              (ts, json.dumps(js), dec))

   # When reading back the data, it is converted automatically based on
   # the declared column types.
   row = db.execute_one('select * from vals')
   assert row == (ts, js, dec)

The converter accepts a ``data_type`` and uses the following rules for matching
a specified data-type to what SQLite tells us:

* Matching is case-insensitive, e.g. ``JSON`` or ``json`` is fine.
* Split on the first whitespace or ``"("`` character, e.g. if SQLite
  tells us the data-type is ``NUMERIC(10, 2)``, cysqlite will attempt to
  find a converter named ``numeric``.

Differences from stdlib
-----------------------

The stdlib ``sqlite3`` module uses different conventions for registering
adapters and converters:

* Adapters and converters in ``sqlite3`` are registered *globally*. In
  ``cysqlite``, they are scoped to the :class:`Connection`.
* ``sqlite3`` converters — functions that transform values coming *from*
  SQLite back into richer Python types — are disabled by default, and are
  enabled via the ``detect_types`` parameter on ``connect()``. Two modes
  are available: matching against the column's declared type
  (``PARSE_DECLTYPES``) and matching against a type hint embedded in a
  column alias (``PARSE_COLNAMES``). cysqlite always matches against
  declared types, and has no column-alias mechanism.
* ``sqlite3`` has a separate adaptation mechanism that checks for a
  ``__conform__()`` method on the object being bound; the method's return
  value is used in place of the original. cysqlite has no equivalent —
  bind either a supported type directly, or register an adapter.
* ``sqlite3`` historically shipped default adapters for ``datetime`` and
  ``date``, and also handled ``datetime`` via two magic type names, but
  these are deprecated as of Python 3.12.

cysqlite is more permissive about what types it will accept at bind time. Any
object with a ``__float__`` method (e.g. ``Decimal``, ``Fraction``) is bound as
``REAL``, and anything else falls back to ``str(x)`` rather than raising
``TypeError``. Additionally, cysqlite provides ISO-8601 formatting for
``datetime`` and ``date`` out of the box with no surprise deprecations.
Sqlite's built-in `date functions <https://sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html>`_
work well on ISO-8601 format, so this allows date/times stored by ``cysqlite``
to be usable with the builtin date functions.

.. _transactions:

Transactions
============

cysqlite operates in pure autocommit mode as this is how SQLite itself operates.
Statements execute immediately unless you've explicitly opened a transaction.
The driver never issues implicit transaction control statements on your behalf.
To use transactions, open one with :meth:`~Connection.begin`, :meth:`~Connection.atomic`,
:meth:`~Connection.transaction`, or by executing ``BEGIN`` directly.

.. code-block:: python

   db = connect(':memory:')

   # Autocommit: each statement is its own transaction.
   db.execute('create table t (x)')
   db.execute('insert into t values (1)')  # Committed immediately.

   # Explicit transaction via context manager.
   with db.atomic():
       db.execute('insert into t values (2)')
       db.execute('insert into t values (3)')
   # Committed on successful exit, rolled back on exception.

   # Or manage it by hand.
   db.begin()
   try:
       db.execute('insert into t values (4)')
       db.commit()
   except:
       db.rollback()
       raise

:attr:`~Connection.in_transaction` uses ``sqlite3_get_autocommit()`` to detect
if a transaction is currently active.

Why autocommit
--------------

SQLite allows only one writer at a time, and a transaction that has performed
**any** write will hold an exclusive lock until it commits or rolls back. An
application that holds transactions open longer than necessary, even by
accident, will see ``OperationalError: database is locked`` under concurrency.
``sqlite3`` makes this class of bug trivially easy to write: you execute an
innocent-looking ``UPDATE``, a transaction opens silently, and then spend some
more time issuing a bunch of ``SELECT`` queries or handling other things before
you call ``commit()``, which finally releases the lock.

``sqlite3`` transactions are an absolute clown show. They use a `string prefix
compare <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/80ba4e10f5070e6d2e35618e08057be44f913965/Modules/_sqlite/statement.c#L82-L91>`_
to detect if a statement is data-modifying, which triggers the silent ``BEGIN``.
The rule, even in Python 3.14, is if the statement starts with ``INSERT``,
``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``, or ``REPLACE``, the driver automatically begins a
transaction before executing it. Predictable consequences:

* ``INSERT INTO ...`` auto-begins a transaction.
* ``/* important comment */ INSERT INTO ...`` does not, because the comment
  comes first.
* ``WITH cte AS (...) INSERT INTO ...`` does not, because it starts with
  ``WITH``. Your CTE-using writes silently run in autocommit while your
  non-CTE writes run in implicit transactions. Good luck debugging.

There was a moment in the Python 3.6 beta cycle where this was going to be
fixed by calling ``sqlite3_stmt_readonly()``, the C API SQLite provides for
exactly this question. The change was reverted before release because it
broke ``conn.execute("BEGIN IMMEDIATE")`` (``BEGIN`` isn't read-only, so the
new logic tried to auto-BEGIN before the user's explicit ``BEGIN`` and
errored). Rather than fix that edge case, the maintainers went back to string
matching and added a second special case for DDL. That's the code that's
been in production since 2016. `Discussion on the SQLite forum <https://www.sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/c5c281dce2>`_
has the full archaeological record if you want to lose an afternoon. I also
tried to get CPython on-board again in 2019 with `this pull request <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/13216>`_
but someone shitted up the discussion with strawmen and the core team decided
to invent an even stupider way to handle things...

.. tip::
   CPython loves treating backwards-compat as sacrosanct when it suits them,
   and aggressively deprecating according to their whims. Right now they are
   moving towards changing the way transactions work (naturally making the
   situation even worse).

Pre-3.12 sqlite3 provided implicit transactions keyed on statement type. By
default a transaction auto-begins before any DML statement using the already-belabored
string compare. This transaction is held open until you call ``commit()`` or
``rollback()``. The ``isolation_level`` parameter controls what flavor of ``BEGIN``
gets emitted, and passing the mysterious incantation ``isolation_level=None`` is
the "open sesame" that disables the auto-begin and gives you something close to
sane:

.. code-block:: python

   # Specifying isolation_level=None tells sqlite3 to leave transaction
   # management alone.
   >>> db = sqlite3.connect(':memory:', isolation_level=None)

   # Wait, what's this? Legacy??
   >>> db.autocommit == sqlite3.LEGACY_TRANSACTION_CONTROL
   True

   # Whatever, at least we are in autocommit mode.
   >>> db.in_transaction
   False

   # Run a transaction.
   >>> db.execute('begin')
   >>> db.in_transaction
   True

   # Let's get out of this transaction.
   >>> db.commit()
   >>> db.in_transaction
   False

This works. It has always worked. But based on how CPython moves fast and
breaks things, expect this to stop working in the next year or two. In its
place, CPython has given us a new, completely separate alternative:

.. code-block:: python

   # Let's do it the way modern Python wants us to.
   >>> db = sqlite3.connect(':memory:', autocommit=True)

   # Isolation level returns an empty string. Empty. It means whatever you
   # want it to mean.
   >>> db.isolation_level
   ''

   >>> db.in_transaction
   False

   # So far so good.
   >>> db.execute('begin')
   >>> db.in_transaction
   True

   # Wait, what the fuck?!
   >>> db.commit()
   >>> db.in_transaction
   True

   >>> db.execute('commit -- who thought this was a good idea?!')
   >>> db.in_transaction
   False

If you didn't catch what happened there, when we set ``autocommit=True``, Python
**silently** turned ``commit()`` into a no-op for some inexplicable reason. No
deprecation warning, no exception. If you call ``commit()`` and then close the
connection, or let it be garbage-collected, all your changes are silently lost.

The icing on the cake is that the "legacy" mode we're supposed to migrate
away from handles this just fine:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> db = sqlite3.connect(':memory:', isolation_level=None)
   >>> db.execute('begin')
   >>> db.in_transaction
   True
   >>> db.execute('commit')
   >>> db.in_transaction
   False

The legacy method just works, you can call the ``commit()`` method or explicitly
execute a ``COMMIT`` query, and both do the obvious thing. The new-and-improved
method is doing all kinds of weird stuff.

The other direction is just as bad. With ``autocommit=False`` (which the
docs now recommend), a transaction begins immediately on connection, lasts
until you commit, and a fresh one begins right after. Every connection is
always in a transaction, forever. For a database whose entire concurrency
story hinges on keeping write transactions short, this is the worst possible
default.

The end result is that, depending on your Python version and which keyword
arguments you passed to ``connect()``, you are now in one of three
incompatible transaction regimes, and in one of them, ``commit()`` silently
does nothing. The predictable consequence is that the standard library has
collected `pull requests <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/137505>`_ like
this one. It's amazing.

cysqlite's answer to all of this: :meth:`~Connection.commit` commits. Always.
:meth:`~Connection.rollback` rolls back. Always. There is no flag to
configure, no legacy mode, and no scenario where calling ``commit()`` is a
no-op. If there is no active transaction, it raises :class:`OperationalError`
rather than silently succeeding.

.. _transactions-recommended:

Recommended patterns
--------------------

:meth:`~Connection.atomic` can wrap a block of code or decorate a function with
transaction semantics, and supports nesting. It opens a transaction at the
outermost level and a savepoint for nested calls:

.. code-block:: python

   with db.atomic():
       db.execute('insert into orders (user_id, total) values (?, ?)',
                  (user_id, total))
       for item in line_items:
           db.execute('insert into order_items (...) values (...)', item)
   # Commits on clean exit; rolls back if anything raised.

Atomic blocks nest **correctly**. A failure inside a nested block rolls back
the savepoint without affecting the outer transaction:

.. code-block:: python

   with db.atomic():
       db.execute('insert into users (name) values (?)', ('alice',))

       try:
           with db.atomic():
               db.execute('insert into users (name) values (?)', ('alice',))
               # IntegrityError — savepoint is rolled back.
       except IntegrityError:
           pass

       # Outer transaction is unaffected. 'alice' is still pending.

   # 'alice' is committed.

If you need a specific lock type, pass ``lock=``. Use ``IMMEDIATE`` when
you know you're going to write and want to fail fast if another writer holds
the lock, rather than discovering it mid-transaction:

.. code-block:: python

   with db.atomic(lock='IMMEDIATE'):
       db.execute('update counters set n = n + 1 where id = ?', (id_,))

If you explicitly want a flat transaction without savepoint nesting, use
:meth:`~Connection.transaction` instead of :meth:`~Connection.atomic`.
Nested ``transaction()`` calls no-op on the inner levels, only the outermost
block controls commit/rollback.

For partial rollbacks within a larger transaction, :meth:`~Connection.atomic`
(or :meth:`~Connection.savepoint`) provides savepoints that can be committed or
rolled-back within a larger atomic context:

.. code-block:: python

   with db.atomic():
       db.execute('insert into log (msg) values (?)', ('step 1',))

       with db.atomic() as sp:
           db.execute('insert into log (msg) values (?)', ('step 2',))
           if something_went_wrong:
               sp.rollback()  # Undo step 2 only.

       db.execute('insert into log (msg) values (?)', ('step 3',))

As a decorator, any of the three helpers wraps the decorated function
in a transaction/savepoint:

.. code-block:: python

   @db.atomic()
   def transfer_funds(from_id, to_id, amount):
       db.execute('update accounts set bal = bal - ? where id = ?',
                  (amount, from_id))
       db.execute('update accounts set bal = bal + ? where id = ?',
                  (amount, to_id))

For all other cases you can explicitly call :meth:`~Connection.begin`,
:meth:`~Connection.commit` and :meth:`~Connection.rollback` (or execute the SQL
directly via ``execute()``).
